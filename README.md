Hi there!

I'm working my way through The Odin Project, and this is my first actual coding assignment from TOP itself (we had been assigned one of the courses on CSS from freecodecamp previously).

The assignment in question can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav

I'm pretty happy with the results! The assignment -did- explicitly say not to worry too much about the styling, but I wanted to experiment a bit with :hover and box-shadow and other small things like that, so... I did! I hope you enjoy, if you're reading this somehow!
